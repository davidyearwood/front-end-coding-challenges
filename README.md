Front-end developers need to continually code, educate, and colloborate to improve their skills. We face our own version of writer's block, coding block. During this period, you feel stagnate, so as a way to combat this dread, I work on front-end coding challenges. These challenges are a good way to improve and practice a myriad of skills: programming, debugging, researching, scoping tasks, and becoming self-sufficient. And it's a lot of fun.
