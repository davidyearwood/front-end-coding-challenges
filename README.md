Front-end developers need to continually look for opportunities to improve their skills. That is 
why I use Front-end coding challenges to do just that. You get a lot of practice programming,
becoming self-sufficient searching and debugging, organizing before a project, and scoping tasks.

The challenges I have completed, and am working can be found in the "Challenges" section below. All challenges have their own "README".
